STLC
STLC - sequence of systematic steps conducted during the testing phase of SDLC
 	  - which structure testing process
	  - helps better identify and report bugs

1. Requirement analysis
	- QA team study US from testing perspective
	- front end VS back end / automated VS manual (or both) / functional VS non-functional
	
2. Test Planning
	- handled trough the meeting
	- Test Plan Document prep by test Lead
	- strategy: / features to be tested 
			   / testing types and tools
  			   / environment
			   / schedule 
			   / soft & hard resources
