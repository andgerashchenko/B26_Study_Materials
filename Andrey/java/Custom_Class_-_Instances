Custom Class - Instances

		
- Writing a Custom Class

		- public class Dog{

			public String name;
			public int age;

			public void eat(){
				System.out.println(name + " is eating dog food");
			}
		}

			- public --> Access Modifier

			- class  --> keyword

			- Dog    --> Class Name

			- name   --> Field(Attribute)

			- age 	 --> Field(Attribute)

			- eat()  --> Method(Action)


- Instance Variables

		- declared inside the class and outside any methods/blocks

		- belongs to the object, and each object has its own memory

		- each object has a separate copy of the instance variable

		- ex:

			public class Dog{
				public String name;
				public String breed;
				public int age;
			}


- Instance Methods

		- does not have static keyword

		- belongs to the object

		- each object has a separate copy of the instance methods

		- ex:

			public void eat(){
				System.out.println(name + " is eating dog food")
			}

			public void drink(){
				System.out.println(name + " is drinking water")
			}


- Creating an Object/Instance

		- the new keyword is used to create an instance of a class

		- ex:

			Dog dog1 = new Dog();

        	dog1.name = "Lucy";
        	dog1.breed = "Husky";
        	dog1.size = "Large";
        	dog1.age = 5;

				- Dog   --> Class Name

				- dog1  --> Object Name

				- new   --> Keyword

				- Dog() --> Constructor


- Printing objects into Console

		- In original class file include:

			--> right click and press Generate

			--> select toString

			--> choose instances you want to print
