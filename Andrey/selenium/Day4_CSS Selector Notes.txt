        ==============  CSS SELECTOR  ============

- cssSelector is one of 8 locators of Selenium.
- With cssSelector we are able to create CUSTOM locators.
- Using cssSelector you will be able to locate web elements with ANY OF THE ATTRIBUTES PROVIDED inside of the tag
- We are not just limited to name, class, or id attributes anymore
- We can use ANY attribute inside of the tag.

=== There are two different types of syntaxes for cssSelector. ===

#1.syntax:	tagName[attribute='valueâ€™]	

     ex: <a href="https://www.tesla.com" id="uh7" name="bb95"> TESLA </a>

    #1- locate above link with cssSelector using id:
         
        a[id='uh7']

    #2- locate above link with cssSelector using name:

        a[name='bb95']

    #3- locate above link with cssSelector using href:    

        a[href='https://www.tesla.com']

  NOTE: If you want to be less specific, you don't have to pass tagName with this locator.

    [attribute='value']

    [id='uh7']

    [name='bb95']


#2.syntax:  Second syntax is limited to use with "id" and "class" only.

    tagName#idValue
    tagName.classValue

    # ---> stands for id attribute
    . ---> stands for class attribute

ex: <a href="https://www.tesla.com" id="uh7" name="bb95" class="kk99"> TESLA </a>

#1- locate above link with cssSelector syntax #2 using id:

    a#uh7 --> this will return me the above web element


#2- locate above link with cssSelector syntax #2 using class attribute value:

    a.kk99


NOTE: If you want to be less specific, you dont even have to type the tagName.
    
    #idValue
    .classValue


=== HOW TO MOVE FROM PARENT TO CHILD USING CSSSELECTOR? ===

- We use ">" sign to move from parent to child.

    syntax: tagName[attribute='value'] > childTagName

ex: Locating "Forgot password" header from http://practice.cydeo.com/forgot_password

    div[id='content'] > div > h2
    div[class='example'] > h2

== Why do we need to move from parent to child? ==
    - Sometimes the web element we are trying to locate does not have a unique attribute/value.
    - In this scenario, we can locate one of the parents that has a unique attribute value, and move down to child web element we are trying to locate.

* We CANNOT go from CHILD TO PARENT using cssSelector.
