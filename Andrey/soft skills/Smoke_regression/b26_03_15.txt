=> your questions  +
=> interviews      +
=> testing types   review 
=> testing levels  review
=> testing layer   - 
=> Smoke           -
=> regression      -  

==========================


=> developers write a code to test their code (automated way) - unit testing 
=> Is system testing the most common type of testing perform by SDET, compare to functionality integration testing? 
mostly system testing, automated tests could be used in functionality integration testing 

=> integration testing
-  code level, developers do that, white box
-  functionality level, between modules / components / services of the application
-  functionality level, between applications, at the same company
-  functionality level, between different companies 

=> white black grey
- white box - unit testing (automated) - with JUnit libraries (using Assertions / AssertL libs as well)
- white box - integration (automated)  - mostly running different unit tests together (developers might do manual testing in dev environment)

- grey box   - manual / automated 
- black box  - manual / automated 

==============================================

=> front end testing 
- we deal with UI / Front end
- manual
- automated 

=> database testing / backend testing
- application data is stored in DB 
- you will test if the data correctly stored in DB
- manually with SQL queries
- automated with JDBC 

=> API Testing 
- can be done manually (postman)

- can be done automated (Rest API)

======================

smoke test 
=======================================
- every day, usually early morning 6am or smth 
- it is like a gate / shield between dev and test env
- checks if the application is up and running
- checks if the environment up and running 
- should be fast (20 mins 30 mins)
- should be some set of tests 
- it is done automated way, and mostly scheduled 
- 15, 20   50 - 60    even 100
