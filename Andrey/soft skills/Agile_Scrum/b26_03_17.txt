==========================


your questions
==========================
=> for integration testing questions
- give the theoretical answer
- then you can add how yo also did integration testing
- how testers can be involved in integration testing 

=> what certifications 
- during the class (OCA, AWS Practitioner, if you have time maybe SM)
- after starting job (java 2, AWS Solution Architect)

=> how often should Smoke Test Suite run?
- if your dev to test deployment is once a day => then 1 time
- if more the moe than once

- it is better to go to the interview once a day deployment from dev to test and this is when our smoke test is running 

smoke test 
=======================================
- every day, usually early morning 6am or smth 
- it is like a gate / shield between dev and test env
- checks if the application is up and running
- checks if the environment up and running 
- should be fast (20 mins 30 mins)
- should be some set of tests 
- it is done automated way, and mostly scheduled 
- 15, 20   50 - 60    even 100
- smoke suite is changeable (dynamic) - you can add and remove 

=> you code (smoke suite) => gitHub => jenkins 

1. scenario name - login functionality
Step one   - go to the url (qa.vytack.com)
Step two   - enter username (correct)
Step three - enter passwords (correct)
Step four  - click login button
Stem five  - you should be able to login to the Vtrack application

- smoke suite is running in a tool called Jenkins (you will learn in here) and it generates the report for you, and it can email / slack it to list you provide 

- what we do after we get smoke result 
- if it passes - chill
- if it fails, you will run failing scenarios in your local environment / machine to make sure it is failing.
- if it still failing you make sure that your testing code is correct
- if everything is ok from your side, then you talk to developer and let them know

==============================================

Regression 
==============================================
- regression runs before releases 
- (it is good for interview to say that we release every 4 or 3 months - so it is time when we run regression)
- in most projects it is not possible to automate all scenarios which is part of regression suite 
- so regression is done both manual and automated (80 - 20, 85 - 15) 
- lets say, 1000 scenarios in your, suite 850 are automated, 150 are manual 
- how many scenarios (300, 500,  - 3000)
- how long does it run (2, 3, 8, 10 hours)


in some companies => they have minor regression and major regression (or just a regression)
- we release every 4 months (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr)
- we have 1000 scenarios already automated 
- each month i run 250 - minor regression
- and before release I run the whole suite - major regression 

effective regression 
- scenarios are not redundant 
- to have as much as possible end to end scenarios, instead of partial ones 
- to have reusable steps 
- refactor scenarios timely manner 

this part is mostly for devops 
- settings of the jenkins job
- how many VMs, or how many threads and pods it is running
