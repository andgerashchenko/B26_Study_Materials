Right now I am working in an ---- project. Through out my experience I have been successfully tested web based application, client server applications and data base as well both in windows and IOS. My main language is Java. I am also good at SQL as I tested data base applications as well. I am exposed to some JavaScript also. I mainly build projects in Maven, also have some experience with Ant. So far worked with different IDEs as Eclipse, Intellj and Netbeans. I have an experience of building automation framework from scratch, using selenium, junit, testng and cucumber. My framework is Page Object Model Cucumber Framework. For repository I am using GitHub, I also have some experience with SVN. For continuous integration I work with Jenkins. In my current project we are using Jira for project management and I am using jira xray add on for test management, which is actually really cool, integrates with my testing framework. I also have experience with ALM, who does not right (here you laugh). I started in a waterfall however last 5 years I an agile team. I am very well exposed all scrum ceremonies. Actually I am a certified scrum master as well. I am performing smoke test and functional testing also regression in a regular bases. If you ask my coworkers, they would probably describe me as a detail oriented person, who sticks to deadlines. Personally, I really like to learn new things and share my knowledge with other. So this is all about me
