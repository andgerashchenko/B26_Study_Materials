=> your questions
=> interviews
=> testing types
=> testing levels
=> testing layer   - 
=> Smoke           -
=> regression      -  

==========================

=> groups 
- interviews 
- pick a topic - technical re explain it to your team / group 


- White Box testing - developers code and then they test their own code
   if you see the application code, and design your test according to the code, it is white box testing

- Grey Box testing - when you have access to the developers' code  (application code) and if tester uses that knowledge to design his / her scenarios - then it is grey box

- Black Box testing -  Testers do not have access to the development code, they test the functionality from the user perspective 


==================================


=> levels of testing
==================================

=> unit testing
- it is a white box testing
- lowest level of testing 
- done by developers
- on dev (development) environment  (not in testing environment)
- unit test - basically testing the code 
- developers code (verb) to test their code (noun)

=> integration testing - code level
- white box  
- second lowest level of testing
- developers do integration 
- to check if small units of the code work fine together 


=> integration testing - functionality level
- black box mostly (maybe gray)
- testers also can do integration testing
- it is done in test env
- it is mostly black box testing
- testing the integration of two or more features together 

- downstream - we send data
- upstream   - we receive data

=> system testing 
- black box (gray box)
- third level 
- we test functionalities / or non fictionality from application perspective (not code)
- actual result vs expected result 
- in test environment 

Manual testers and Automation Testers test the software without knowing the internal code - black box testing

Automation testers partially know the internal code when testing the software- gray box testing
