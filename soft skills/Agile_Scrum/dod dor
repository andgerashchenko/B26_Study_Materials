V- Valuable - Something this adds value to the user
E- Estimable - No Research Required, well understood 
S- Small - Should not take more than one sprint to finish 
T- Testable - Actually able to test it

M - Measurable - Clearly specifies what the team needs to do to achieve the objective
A - Attainable - Should be able to achieve the objective within the teams
R - Relevant - Should be specific to the value being delivered
S - Specific - States the intended outcome as simply, and concisely as possible
