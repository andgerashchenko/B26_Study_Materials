=====================

=> Agile
=>Â Scrum
=> your questions
=> interview 

====================

you will hear the word framework in two concepts
- agile frameworks - scrum, kanban, scrumban
- combination of tools, that will help you to automate manual scenarios 

=> how do you choose a test case to be part of your regression suite
- every automated scenario is part of regression suite 
- which scenario to automate 
- if it will be run more than once 
- takes more time
- there are more chances of errors in manual runs 

=> when defect is found by end user in real life, it is called production defect
- after fix, we run / rerun /retest the scenarios related to that feature / defect
- and before the release we run regression again 

=> who is making test framework
- it is done by test architect, or senior test automation engineers 

=> who some companies use waterfall
- if not competitors - like in military 

SOFTWARE Methodologies 
===================================================== 
=> Waterfall
=> Agile 
under agile we have different implementations or frameworks 
- agile manifesto 
all rules about agile are collected under agile manifesto
4 agile values
12 agile principals 

4 agile values
1- Trust individuals and prefer interactions over processes and tools
2- Focus on delivering working software rather than complete documentation
3- More customer involvement than just negotiation
4- Willing to accommodate changes instead of being rigid to a plan

12 agile principals 


Scrum
=====================================================
- roles
- events / meetings / ceremonies 
- artifacts 


roles
=====================================================
=> product owner
- is a bridge between the customer / client and the dev team 
- the voice of the customer
- is a contact for the dev team for requirement clarification (if we do not have BA in the team)
- Represents client
- Defines all product features / user stories
- Responsible for prioritizing product features
- Maintains the Product Backlog
- Cross responsibility - Communication

=> Scrum Master (SM)
- Is a facilitator not a manager / Process coach
- Removes obstacles / impediments / problems
- Shields the team from external interference
- Maintains the Sprint Burn down Chart
- Holds daily 15 minute team meeting (Daily Scrum)
- Conducts Sprint Retrospective at the end of a Sprint
- Cross responsibility - Scrum process

=> Development Team
- Team is cross-functional and consists of 5-9 people
- Team completes tasks and assignments
- Team is self-organizing and self-managing
- Maintains the Sprint Backlog
- Cross responsibility - Delivering value

artifacts
========================================================
=> Product Backlog - (PB)
- List of all desired product features
- List of User Stories
- List can contain bugs, and non-functional items
- Product Owner responsible for prioritizing and maintaining
- Items can be added by anyone at anytime
- Each item should have a business value assigned

=> Sprint Backlog ? (SB)
- List of To-do list for the current Sprint
- Project tasks are pulled from Product Backlog
- Created by SM
- Managed by the development Team
- Once a Sprint has started no new tasks can be added to the Sprint backlog

=> Burn-down Chart ? (BC)
- Chart showing how much work remaining in a Sprint
- Calculated in hours remaining
- Provides visual uncompleted tasks
- Maintained by the Scrum Master daily 

in scrum we have scrum teams, which has all three roles - PO, Dev Team, SM
inside the scrum team we have testers and developers which we call dev team
