=> interview
=> Project
=> questions 

====================

Scrum meetings
=====================================
=> grooming meeting 
- PO creates User Stories
- dev team owns it, it means they will work on it 
- dev and testers have to make sure User Stories are clearly written
- pointing / estimation is happening - we will learn next class
- time box
=====================================


Estimation
=====================================
=> to size, in order to know how many user stories can team take during the sprint 
=> complexity  1. Login / Sign in functionality   2.Sign Up / register functionality
=> testers must make sure that US and AC is clearly defined 
=> testers must make sure that test data is included to the story 

Sprint 2 - 40,  Sprint 3 - 36,   Sprint 4 - 42,  Sprint 5 - ? 

Sprint Velocity = the average points (sprint) you have completed till

Sprint Velocity is - 40
Sprint Capacity - if the whole team is available 

===================================

Sprint Planning
===================================
=> Sprint Goal - what team is going to accomplish during the sprint
=> whole team agrees on the commitment 
=> once again make sure US and AC are clear, test data is there
=> developers will assign themselves the stories and after that testers will test
=> Story is ready for development - Definition of ready  (DOR)
=> SM, PO (BA) and dev team attends 
=> 1 or 2 hours depending your sprint length 
=> first day of the sprint 

===========================================

=> Definition of Ready
- (when) in the sprint planning meeting 
- (what)is a checklist for the dev team to take the user story is ready to work on
- (who) creates it? scrum team together. 

1. User Story should have clear description 
2. User Story should have clear acceptance criteria 
3. User Story and acceptance criteria are written in gherkin language 
4. It is small enough to be developed and tested during the sprint 
5. Test data is included to the user story 

User Story matches Invest: 
I - Independent - to the extent possible, doesn’t depend on other stories
N- Negotiable - A story is a conversation starter, not the end result. Never talks about “how”
V- Valuable - Something this adds value to the user
E- Estimable - No Research Required, well understood 
S- Small - Should not take more than one sprint to finish 
T- Testable - Actually able to test it

M - Measurable - Clearly specifies what the team needs to do to achieve the objective
A - Attainable - Should be able to achieve the objective within the teams
R - Relevant - Should be specific to the value being delivered
S - Specific - States the intended outcome as simply, and concisely as possible

=========================================

Daily Stand up 
=========================================
=> 15 mins
=> usually in the morning 
=> set time - 9.30 am or 10am etc 
=> what did you do yesterday
=> what are you working on today 
=> any blocker? / impediments? 
=> if there is something needs detailed discussion, team calls it parking lot item and discuss after everyone gives their status
=> SM, dev team, BA (when required PO can attend) if you do not have BA, then PO attends


Sprint review == demo meeting 
===========================
=> happens at the end of the sprint - last day
=> PO hosts
=> SM dev team BA PO and stakeholder attend
=> team demos USs to PO 
=> PO either accepts or rejects 
=> 1 hour or 2, depending the length of the sprint 

=> Definition of Done
=======================
- (when) demo (Sprint Review) 
- (what) check list for Product Owner to accept the story
- (who) mostly PO and scrum adds some points  

that could differ from project to project
1. Test scenarios have been reviewed by client (maybe team / or PO / lead)
2. Development code had peer reviewed and documented 
3. Testing has been completed - functional (manual) 
4. Automation testing had been completed (if applicable)
5. Any defects fixed or deferred or marked as an known issue 
6. All test results documented 
7. Demoed to the PO / client
8. Accepted (signed off)
